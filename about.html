      <h2>Hi, I'm Revathi!</h2>
      <p>I'm an enthusiastic learner who finds joy in solving problems and creating innovative solutions using emerging technologies. My journey has led me deep into the world of <strong>prompt engineering</strong> and <strong>machine learning model training</strong>, where I love experimenting with AI models and discovering how to make them smarter, more efficient, and more human-friendly.</p>

      <p>Every day, I strive to <strong>upgrade my skills</strong>—whether it's diving into a new programming language, exploring AI applications, or pushing the boundaries of what I can build. I believe learning should never stop, and I enjoy sharing knowledge with others just as much as I love gaining it.</p>

      <p>With each project I take on, I aim to blend creativity with logic, and I'm always eager to take the next leap in my growth as a tech professional.</p>
