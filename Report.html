  <h1>ðŸŽµ Telugu Music Genre Prediction & Playback System</h1>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This project presents a desktop application developed in C using the Windows API that predicts the genre of Telugu songs based on their musical features and enables instant playback via YouTube. The system reads a dataset containing song attributes such as danceability, acousticness, energy, and popularity. These inputs are processed through a rule-based genre prediction model, neural networks with initialized weights.
    The graphical user interface allows users to enter a song name, view its predicted genre, and play the song on YouTube with a single click. This project uniquely combines machine learning logic with user interactivity, offering both educational and entertainment value. It demonstrates real-time genre classification and multimedia integration, showcasing a practical use of data science and C programming in multimedia applications.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In todayâ€™s digital music era, the ability to automatically identify and classify music genres is increasingly valuable for enhancing user experience, curating personalized playlists, and supporting intelligent music recommendation systems. Manual categorization of songs is subjective and inconsistent, especially when dealing with large-scale and diverse music libraries. To streamline this process, I tried a Music Genre Prediction and Playback System that combines feature-based classification with real-time song search and playback capabilities.
    This system applies Artificial Neural Network (ANN) principles and rule-based logic to classify Telugu songs into genres such as Pop, Classical, Dance, Hip-Hop, and others. By analyzing various audio-related attributesâ€”such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, and speechinessâ€”the system predicts the most probable genre for a given track. To further enhance interactivity, users can instantly play the song on YouTube, bridging genre recognition with real-world usability.

  <h3>Key Components</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Feature-Based Classification: Genre prediction is driven by an analysis of preprocessed song attributes, which reflect the musical essence of each track.</li>
    <li>Simplified Neural Logic: A manually weighted, multi-layer feedforward structure mimics ANN behavior to deliver genre predictions with reasonable accuracy.</li>
    <li>Interactive GUI with Playback Support: A user-friendly Windows interface enables song input, displays predictions, and facilitates real-time playback through automated YouTube search.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    By integrating music analysis with playback, this project showcases a practical and engaging application of AI in digital entertainment. Future enhancements may include dynamic learning with real ANN models, support for multiple languages or genres, and integration with audio signal processing for direct MP3 analysis.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The Music Genre Prediction and Playback System successfully demonstrates how artificial intelligence can enhance the music listening experience by automating genre classification and enabling instant playback. By analyzing key musical attributes and employing neural-inspired logic, the system achieves accurate, real-time predictions for Telugu songs while maintaining a simple and intuitive user interface.
    This project not only simplifies genre identification for music enthusiasts and developers but also showcases the practical application of ANN concepts in multimedia processing. The integration of playback functionality further bridges the gap between data analysis and user engagement, making the system both functional and entertaining.
    Looking ahead, the system offers significant potential for expansion. Incorporating real ANN training methods or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) could improve accuracy and allow the model to learn directly from audio signals. Furthermore, expanding support to include multilingual tracks and a broader range of genres would make the system more versatile and suitable for global music libraries.
    In essence, this project marks a meaningful step toward intelligent music applications, blending artificial intelligence with digital entertainment to create a smarter and more enjoyable music discovery experience.
